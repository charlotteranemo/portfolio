# My portfolio

## What is this?

To get an idea of what this code does, I suggest you visit my uploaded version of my portfolio at: http://charlotteranemo.se

This is the source code of that portfolio, which I have created to portray my previous work, workplaces and education.

## How does it work?

I have used webpack to automatize the building of this website. If you clone the code, do an npm install and then a npm run build to get the build going, it's that simple. It also works on localhost by running npm install and then npm start.

NOTE: I have ignored, among other things, the pictures folder when I uploaded to github, so that won't be cloned.

This portfolio uses my REST API, which you can see the source code for here: https://github.com/charlotteranemo/portfolio-rest

I update this portfolio by using my admin-page, which you can find here: http://charlotteranemo.se/pAdmin
